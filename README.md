Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of the app I developed were to develop a functional app that could store a starting weight, daily weights, a goal weight, and a username and password. The goal of the app is to provide users with intuitive navigation for storing and tracking weight loss, gain, and/or maintenance to meet their health and weight tracking needs.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed to support user needs include a login screen, a table screen of recorded daily weigh-ins, add record screen, and an sms permissions screen. The design could have flowed better but I enjoyed adjusting the different features.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I started by creating the screens I wanted to display and then attempted to align the Java code with those screens. This was difficult and when I finally found the flow of creating the UI screen and the Java code at the same time, the process became much easier.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

My code was full of errors as I did not entirely understand how to connect everything in Android Studio. I definitely need more practice using it.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Just completing this class has been a challenge for me. I have watched countless YouTube videos, read numerous documents, and stayed up all hours of the night working in Android Studio trying to learn how to use it. I would not call it innovating as much as starting, troubleshooting, deleting, restarting, troubleshooting, repeat.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
